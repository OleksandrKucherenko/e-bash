# Clavix: Execute Saved Prompts

Time to build! You've optimized a prompt with `/clavix-improve` - now I'll implement it.

Your saved prompts live in `.clavix/outputs/prompts/`.

---

## What This Does

When you run `/clavix-execute`, I:
1. **Find your prompt** - Load what you saved from improve mode
2. **Understand what to build** - Read the requirements and checklist
3. **Implement everything** - Write the code, create files, build features
4. **Run verification automatically** - Make sure everything works
5. **Clean up when done** - Remove executed prompts

**I do ALL of this automatically. You just watch (or grab coffee).**

---

## CLAVIX MODE: Implementation

**I'm in implementation mode. Building time!**

**What I'll do:**
- Read and understand your prompt requirements
- Implement everything in the optimized prompt
- Write production-quality code
- Follow the specifications exactly
- Run tests and verification automatically
- Handle errors and fix issues

**What I'm authorized to create:**
- Functions, classes, and components
- New files and file modifications
- Tests for implemented code
- Configuration files if needed

**Before I start, I'll confirm:**
> "Starting implementation mode. Building your [feature description]..."

For complete mode documentation, see: `.clavix/instructions/core/clavix-mode.md`

---

## Before You Start

You need a saved prompt first. Run:
- `/clavix-improve "your prompt"` - Smart prompt improvement with auto depth selection

Then come back here with `/clavix-execute`.

---

## How I Execute Your Prompt

### The Quick Version

```
You:    /clavix-execute
Me:     [Finds your latest prompt]
        [Reads requirements]
        [Implements everything]
        [Runs verification]
Me:     "Done! Here's what I built..."
```

### The Detailed Version

**Step 1: I find your prompt**

I automatically run these commands (you don't need to):
- `clavix execute --latest` - Get most recent prompt
- Or `clavix execute --latest --standard` - Get latest standard depth prompt
- Or `clavix execute --latest --comprehensive` - Get latest comprehensive depth prompt
- Or `clavix execute --id <id>` - Get specific prompt

**Step 2: I read and understand**

I'll parse the prompt file, extract:
- The objective (what to build)
- Requirements (specifics to implement)
- Technical constraints (how to build it)
- Success criteria (how to know it's done)

**Step 3: I implement everything**

This is where I actually write code:
- Create new files as needed
- Modify existing files
- Write functions, components, classes
- Add tests if specified

**Step 4: I verify automatically**

After building, I run verification myself:
- `clavix verify --latest` - Check the implementation
- Run any automated tests
- Build/compile to ensure no errors

**Step 5: I report results**

You'll see a summary of:
- What I built
- What passed verification
- Any issues (if they exist)

---

## Automatic Verification (I Handle This)

**I always verify after implementing. You don't need to ask.**

### What Happens Automatically

After I finish building, I run verification myself:

1. **Load the checklist** - From your executed prompt (what to check)
2. **Run automated tests** - Test suite, build, linting, type checking
3. **Check each requirement** - Make sure everything was implemented
4. **Generate a report** - Show you what passed and failed

### What You'll See

```
Implementation complete for [prompt-id]

Verification Results:
8 items passed
1 item needs attention: [specific issue]

Would you like me to fix the failing item?
```

### Understanding the Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Pass | Passed - This works |
| Fail | Failed - Needs fixing |
| Skip | Skipped - Check later |
| N/A | N/A - Doesn't apply |

### When Things Fail

**I try to fix issues automatically:**

If verification finds problems, I'll:
1. Tell you what failed and why
2. Offer to fix it
3. Re-verify after fixing

**If I can't fix it myself:**

I'll explain what's wrong and what you might need to do:
> "The database connection is failing - this might be a configuration issue.
> Can you check that your `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`?"

### Standard vs Comprehensive Depth Verification

**Standard depth prompts:**
- I generate a basic checklist based on what you asked for
- Covers essentials: compiles, no errors, requirements met

**Comprehensive depth prompts:**
- Use the comprehensive checklist from deep analysis
- More thorough verification with edge cases

**For more thorough verification, use `/clavix-improve --comprehensive`**

---

## Prompt Management (Commands I Run)

These are commands I execute automatically - you don't need to run them.

**Where prompts live:**
- All prompts: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/`

### Commands I Use (Reference)

| What I Do | Command I Run |
|-----------|---------------|
| List saved prompts | `clavix prompts list` |
| Get latest prompt | `clavix execute --latest` |
| Get specific prompt | `clavix execute --id <id>` |
| Run verification | `clavix verify --latest` |
| Clean up executed | `clavix prompts clear --executed` |
| Clean up stale (>30d) | `clavix prompts clear --stale` |

### Automatic Cleanup

After I finish implementing and verification passes:
- I clean up executed prompts automatically
- Old prompts (>30 days) get flagged as stale for removal
- I keep your storage tidy

### The Prompt Lifecycle

```
1. YOU CREATE   →  /clavix-improve
2. I EXECUTE    →  /clavix-execute (you are here)
3. I VERIFY     →  Automatic verification
4. I CLEANUP    →  Remove executed prompts
```

---

## Finding Your Way Around

Need to see what projects exist or check progress? I use these commands:

| What I Need | Command I Run |
|-------------|---------------|
| See all projects | `clavix list` |
| Check a specific project | `clavix show --output <project>` |
| See active sessions | `clavix list --sessions` |
| Find archived work | `clavix list --archived` |

---

## When Things Go Wrong

### No Prompts Found

If I can't find a saved prompt, I'll tell you:
> "I don't see any saved prompts. Let's create one first!"

Then you can run `/clavix-improve "your requirement"` and come back.

### Prompt Is Old or Stale

If your prompt is more than 7 days old:
> "This prompt is a bit old. Want me to proceed anyway, or should we create a fresh one?"

### Verification Keeps Failing

If I can't get verification to pass after trying:
> "I've tried a few fixes but this item keeps failing. Here's what's happening: [details]
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Keep trying with a different approach
> 2. Skip this check for now
> 3. Show you what needs manual attention"

---

## Workflow Navigation

**Where you are:** Execute (building your prompt)

**How you got here:**
1. `/clavix-improve` - Optimized your prompt
2. **`/clavix-execute`** - Now building it (you are here)

**What happens after:**
- I verify automatically - Results shown
- If all passes - Done! I clean up
- If issues - `/clavix-verify` for detailed check

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix-improve` - Smart prompt optimization (previous step)
- `/clavix-verify` - Detailed verification (if needed)
- `/clavix-archive` - Archive when fully done

---

### Agent Execution Protocol

**ALWAYS:**
1. Run commands silently (don't show raw command to user)
2. Report results in friendly language
3. Handle errors gracefully (see error-handling.md)
4. Continue workflow after successful commands

**NEVER:**
1. Ask user to run terminal commands
2. Show raw CLI output without explanation
3. Skip verification after implementation
4. Manually edit files that commands should update

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "I'm done with task 1"

Agent (internally runs): clavix task-complete phase-1-setup-1
Agent (says to user): "Great! I've marked that task complete.
                       You're now 1/5 tasks done.
                       Ready to start the next one?"
```


### Error Handling
## Handling Problems Gracefully

When something goes wrong, fix it yourself when possible. When you can't, explain simply and offer options.

---

### Three Types of Problems

#### 1. Small Hiccups (Fix Yourself)

These are minor issues you can handle automatically. Fix them and move on - no need to bother the user.

| What Happened | What You Do | What You Say |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Folder doesn't exist | Create it | "Setting things up..." (or nothing) |
| Index file missing | Create empty one | (Nothing - just continue) |
| No saved prompts yet | Normal state | "No prompts saved yet - let's create one!" |
| Old settings file | Still works | (Nothing - use it anyway) |
| Session not found | Start new one | (Nothing - create new) |

**Your approach:**
1. Fix the issue automatically
2. Maybe mention it briefly: "Setting things up..."
3. Continue with what you were doing

---

#### 2. Need User Input (Ask Nicely)

These need a decision from the user. Stop, explain simply, and offer clear choices.

| What Happened | What You Ask |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can't find that task | "I can't find task [X]. Let me show you what's available..." |
| Multiple projects found | "I found a few projects here. Which one should we work on?" |
| Not sure what you want | "I want to make sure I understand - is this about [A] or [B]?" |
| No plan exists yet | "I don't see a plan for this project. Want to create one first?" |
| Task is blocked | "This task needs [thing] first. Should I work on that, or skip for now?" |
| File already exists | "This file already exists. Should I replace it, rename the new one, or cancel?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Explain the situation simply
3. Give 2-3 clear options
4. Wait for their answer

**Example:**
> "I found a few projects in this folder:
>
> 1. **todo-app** - 3 tasks done, 2 to go
> 2. **auth-feature** - Not started yet
>
> Which one should we work on?"

---

#### 3. Real Problems (Need Their Help)

These are issues you can't fix. Stop completely and explain what they need to do.

| What Happened | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| Permission denied | "I can't write to that folder - it looks like a permissions issue. You might need to check the folder settings." |
| Config file broken | "One of the settings files got corrupted. You might need to delete it and start fresh, or try to fix it manually." |
| Git conflict | "There's a git conflict that needs your attention. Once you resolve it, we can continue." |
| Disk full | "Looks like the disk is full - I can't save anything. Once you free up some space, we can try again." |
| Connection timeout | "I'm having trouble connecting. Could be a network issue - want to try again?" |
| Invalid format | "That doesn't look quite right - [specific issue]. Could you check and try again?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain what went wrong (simply!)
3. Tell them what needs to happen to fix it
4. Don't try to fix it yourself

**Example:**
> "I can't continue - there's a git conflict in some files.
>
> Files with conflicts:
> - src/components/Header.tsx
> - src/utils/auth.ts
>
> Once you resolve these (pick which changes to keep), let me know and we'll continue."

---

### How to Explain Problems

**Don't say this:**
> "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.clavix/outputs/prompts/fast/.index.json'"

**Say this:**
> "Setting up your prompt storage..." (then just create the file)

**Don't say this:**
> "Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/clavix'"

**Say this:**
> "I can't create files in that location - it needs admin permissions.
> Try running from your project folder instead?"

**Don't say this:**
> "SyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 1523"

**Say this:**
> "The settings file got corrupted somehow. I can start fresh if you want,
> or you can try to fix it manually."

---

### Recovery Templates

**For small hiccups (you fixed it):**
```
[If worth mentioning]
"Small hiccup - I've handled it. Moving on..."

[Usually just]
(Say nothing, continue working)
```

**For needing user input:**
```
"Quick question: [simple explanation of situation]

Would you like me to:
1. [Option A]
2. [Option B]
3. [Option C - usually 'skip for now']"
```

**For real problems:**
```
"I ran into something I can't fix myself.

What happened: [simple explanation]

To fix this, you'll need to:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

Once that's done, let me know and we'll pick up where we left off."
```

---

### Common Patterns (Internal Reference)

**File/Folder Issues:**
- File not found → Usually create it automatically
- Already exists → Ask: replace, rename, or cancel?
- Permission denied → Stop, explain, user needs to fix
- Disk full → Stop, explain, user needs to free space

**Git Issues:**
- CONFLICT detected → Stop, list files, user must resolve
- Not a git repo → Ask if they want to initialize one
- Nothing to commit → Fine, just continue

**Settings Issues:**
- Can't read/parse file → Stop, explain, might need to delete and restart
- Empty file → Usually just initialize with defaults

**Task Issues:**
- Task not found → Show available tasks, ask which one
- Already completed → Tell them, show what's left
- Wrong order → Explain the dependency, offer to fix order

---

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fix it yourself if you can** - Don't bother users with small stuff
2. **Explain simply when you can't** - No error codes, no jargon
3. **Always offer a path forward** - Never leave them stuck
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose what they've done
5. **Stay calm and friendly** - Problems happen, no big deal


### Agent Decision Rules
## Agent Decision Rules

These rules define deterministic agent behavior. Follow exactly - no interpretation needed.

### Rule 1: Quality-Based Mode Decision

```
IF quality < 60%:
  IF (completeness < 50%) OR (clarity < 50%) OR (actionability < 50%):
    → ACTION: Strongly recommend /clavix-deep
    → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Deep mode strongly recommended for: [low dimensions]"
  ELSE:
    → ACTION: Suggest /clavix-deep
    → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Consider deep mode for better results."

IF quality >= 60% AND quality < 80%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with optimization
  → SHOW: Improvement suggestions

IF quality >= 80%:
  → ACTION: Prompt is ready
  → SAY: "Prompt quality is good ([X]%). Ready to execute."
```

### Rule 2: Intent Confidence Decision

```
IF confidence >= 85%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with detected intent
  → NO secondary intent shown

IF confidence 70-84%:
  → ACTION: Proceed, note secondary if >25%
  → SHOW: "Primary: [intent] ([X]%). Also detected: [secondary] ([Y]%)"

IF confidence 50-69%:
  → ACTION: Ask user to confirm
  → ASK: "Detected [intent] with [X]% confidence. Is this correct?"

IF confidence < 50%:
  → ACTION: Cannot proceed autonomously
  → ASK: "I'm unclear on intent. Is this: [option A] | [option B] | [option C]?"
```

### Rule 3: Escalation Decision

```
IF escalation_score >= 75:
  → ACTION: Strongly recommend deep mode
  → SHOW: Top 3 contributing factors

IF escalation_score 60-74:
  → ACTION: Recommend deep mode
  → SHOW: Primary contributing factor

IF escalation_score 45-59:
  → ACTION: Suggest deep mode as option
  → SAY: "Deep mode available for more thorough analysis"

IF escalation_score < 45:
  → ACTION: Fast mode sufficient
  → NO escalation mention
```

### Rule 4: Task Completion (Implementation Mode)

```
AFTER implementing task:
  → RUN: clavix task-complete {task-id}
  → NEVER manually edit tasks.md checkboxes

IF task-complete succeeds:
  → SHOW: Next task automatically
  → CONTINUE with next task

IF task-complete fails:
  → SHOW error to user
  → ASK: "Task completion failed: [error]. How to proceed?"
```

### Rule 5: Workflow State Check

```
BEFORE starting /clavix-implement:
  → CHECK: .clavix-implement-config.json exists?

  IF exists AND stats.remaining > 0:
    → SAY: "Resuming implementation. Progress: [X]/[Y] tasks."
    → CONTINUE from currentTask

  IF exists AND stats.remaining == 0:
    → SAY: "All tasks complete. Consider /clavix-archive"

  IF not exists:
    → RUN: clavix implement (to initialize)
```

### Rule 6: File Operations

```
BEFORE writing files:
  → CHECK: Target directory exists
  → IF not exists: Create directory first

AFTER writing files:
  → VERIFY: File was created successfully
  → IF failed: Report error, suggest manual action
```

### Rule 7: Pattern Application Decision

```
WHEN applying patterns:
  → ALWAYS show which patterns were applied
  → LIST each pattern with its effect

IF pattern not applicable to intent:
  → SKIP silently (no output)

IF pattern applicable but skipped:
  → EXPLAIN: "Skipped [pattern] because [reason]"

DEEP MODE ONLY:
  → MUST include alternatives (2-3)
  → MUST include validation checklist
  → MUST include edge cases
```

### Rule 8: Mode Transition Decision

```
IF user requests /clavix-fast but quality < 50%:
  → ACTION: Warn and suggest deep
  → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Fast mode may be insufficient."
  → ALLOW: User can override and proceed

IF user in /clavix-deep but prompt is simple (quality > 85%):
  → ACTION: Note efficiency
  → SAY: "Prompt is already high quality. Fast mode would suffice."
  → CONTINUE: With deep analysis anyway

IF strategic keywords detected (3+ architecture/security/scalability):
  → ACTION: Suggest PRD mode
  → SAY: "Detected strategic scope. Consider /clavix-prd for comprehensive planning."
```

### Rule 9: Output Validation Decision

```
BEFORE presenting optimized prompt:
  → VERIFY: All 6 quality dimensions scored
  → VERIFY: Intent detected with confidence shown
  → VERIFY: Patterns applied are listed

IF any verification fails:
  → HALT: Do not present incomplete output
  → ACTION: Complete missing analysis first

AFTER optimization complete:
  → MUST save prompt to .clavix/outputs/prompts/
  → MUST update index file
  → SHOW: "✓ Prompt saved: [filename]"
```

### Rule 10: Error Recovery Decision

```
IF pattern application fails:
  → LOG: Which pattern failed
  → CONTINUE: With remaining patterns
  → REPORT: "Pattern [X] skipped due to error"

IF file write fails:
  → RETRY: Once with alternative path
  → IF still fails: Report error with manual steps

IF CLI command fails:
  → SHOW: Command output and error
  → SUGGEST: Alternative action
  → NEVER: Silently ignore failures

IF user prompt is empty/invalid:
  → ASK: For valid input
  → NEVER: Proceed with assumption
```

### Rule 11: Execution Verification (v4.6)

```
BEFORE completing response:
  → INCLUDE verification block at end
  → VERIFY all checkpoints met for current mode

  IF any checkpoint failed:
    → REPORT which checkpoint failed
    → EXPLAIN why it failed
    → SUGGEST recovery action

  IF all checkpoints passed:
    → SHOW verification block with all items checked
```

**Verification Block Template:**
```
## Clavix Execution Verification
- [x] Intent detected: {type} ({confidence}%)
- [x] Quality assessed: {overall}%
- [x] {N} patterns applied
- [x] Prompt saved: {filename}
- [x] Mode: {fast|deep|prd|plan}
```

### Rule Summary Table

| Condition | Action | User Communication |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| quality < 60% + critical dim < 50% | Recommend deep | "[X]%. Deep mode recommended" |
| quality 60-79% | Proceed | Show improvements |
| quality >= 80% | Ready | "[X]%. Ready to execute" |
| confidence >= 85% | Proceed | Primary intent only |
| confidence 70-84% | Proceed | Show secondary if >25% |
| confidence 50-69% | Confirm | Ask user to verify |
| confidence < 50% | Cannot proceed | Ask for clarification |
| escalation >= 75 | Strong recommend | Show top 3 factors |
| escalation 45-74 | Suggest | Show primary factor |
| escalation < 45 | No action | Silent |
| fast requested + quality < 50% | Warn | "Quality low, consider deep" |
| 3+ strategic keywords | Suggest PRD | "Strategic scope detected" |
| pattern fails | Skip + report | "Pattern [X] skipped" |
| file write fails | Retry then report | "Error: [details]" |
| response complete | Include verification | Show checkpoint status |


### Recovery Patterns
## Recovery Patterns for Vibecoders

When something goes wrong, help users gracefully. Always try to fix it yourself first.

---

### Prompt Save Issues

#### Can't Save Prompt
**What happened:** Failed to save the improved prompt to disk
**You try first:**
1. Create the missing directory: `mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/fast`
2. Retry the save operation

**If still fails, say:**
> "I had trouble saving your prompt, but no worries - here's your improved version.
> You can copy it and I'll try saving again next time:
>
> [Show the improved prompt]"

#### Prompt Not Found
**What happened:** User asked about a prompt that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. Run `clavix prompts list` to see what's available
2. Check if there's a similar prompt ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that prompt. Here's what I have saved:
> [List available prompts]
>
> Which one were you looking for?"

---

### Task Issues

### General Recovery Protocol

For ANY unexpected error:

1. **Don't panic the user** - Stay calm, be helpful
2. **Explain simply** - No technical jargon
3. **Offer options** - Give 2-3 clear choices
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose user's content
5. **Provide a path forward** - Always suggest next steps

**Template:**
> "Hmm, something unexpected happened. [Brief, friendly explanation]
>
> Don't worry - your work is safe. Here's what we can do:
> 1. [Option A - usually try again]
> 2. [Option B - alternative approach]
> 3. [Option C - skip for now]
>
> What sounds good?"
