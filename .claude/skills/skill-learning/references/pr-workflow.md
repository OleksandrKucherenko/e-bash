# Pull Request Workflow

All contributions to the skills repository go through pull requests (PRs), not direct commits to main. This ensures quality, enables review, and maintains a clear contribution history.

## Why Pull Requests?

**Quality control:**
- Changes reviewed before merging
- Catch errors or unclear instructions
- Validate improvements are sound

**Collaboration:**
- Discuss alternatives and tradeoffs
- Learn from reviewer feedback
- Build shared understanding

**History:**
- Clear record of what changed and why
- Attributable contributions
- Easy to revert if needed

**Learning:**
- Feedback improves your future contributions
- See how others approach problems
- Collective knowledge building

## PR Workflow Steps

### 1. Create Feature Branch

**Before making changes,** create a branch for your work.

**Branch naming conventions:**
```
add/skill-name              # New skill
update/skill-name-aspect    # Update existing skill
fix/skill-name-issue        # Fix error or bug
clarify/skill-name-section  # Improve clarity
```

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout -b add/api-rate-limiting
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

**Update or create skills:**
- Edit SKILL.md files
- Add/update reference files
- Include examples if helpful
- Update README if adding new skill

**Test your changes:**
- Read through as if you're seeing it for first time
- Check that examples work
- Verify links/references are correct
- Ensure formatting is clean

**Best practices:**
- Keep changes focused (one improvement per PR)
- Preserve existing valid content
- Write clearly and concisely
- Include examples where helpful

### 3. Stage and Commit Changes

**Stage relevant files:**
```bash
git add path/to/changed/files
```

**Write clear commit message:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add exponential backoff pattern to API integration

Includes retry logic with jitter for rate limiting scenarios.
Tested across OpenRouter, Anthropic, and OpenAI APIs."
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<Short summary of change>

<Longer explanation of what and why>
<Evidence or testing notes if relevant>
```

### 4. Push Branch to Remote

**First time pushing branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin add/api-rate-limiting
```

**Subsequent pushes:**
```bash
git push
```

### 5. Create Pull Request

**Use GitHub web interface or CLI (gh):**
```bash
gh pr create --title "Add API rate limiting patterns" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What

Adds exponential backoff pattern for handling API rate limits.

## Why

Hit rate limiting 5 times across different projects. Spent ~30 minutes 
each time figuring out retry logic. No existing skill documents this 
common pattern.

## Evidence

- Tested on OpenRouter, Anthropic API, OpenAI API
- 100% success rate across 20 test scenarios
- Pattern aligns with HTTP RFC recommendations
- Prevents 429 errors with minimal latency addition

## Impact

Saves debugging time when integrating external APIs. Prevents rate limit 
errors that cause user-facing failures.

## Testing

Created test scenarios with intentional rate limiting. Verified backoff 
logic works correctly and doesn't retry indefinitely.

```

### 7. Respond to Feedback

**Reviewers may:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Request additional examples
- Point out edge cases
- Propose refinements

**How to respond:**
- Address feedback constructively
- Make requested changes if they improve the contribution
- Explain your reasoning if you disagree
- Iterate based on discussion
- Thank reviewers for their time

**Making changes based on feedback:**
```bash
# Make updates to files
git add path/to/files
git commit -m "Address review feedback: Add edge case examples"
git push
```

Changes automatically appear in the PR.

### 8. Merge After Approval

**Once approved:**
- Reviewer or maintainer will merge PR
- Changes go into main branch
- Your contribution is now part of the repository

**After merge:**
- Your branch can be deleted
- PR remains in history with full discussion
- Changes available to all agents

## PR Best Practices

### Keep PRs Focused

**Good - Single focused improvement:**
```
PR: "Add memory_insert safety warning to concurrency section"
Changes: 1 file, clear improvement, easy to review
```

**Bad - Multiple unrelated changes:**
```
PR: "Update multiple skills"
Changes: 5 files across 3 different skills, unclear theme
Better: Split into 3 separate PRs
```

### Write Clear PR Titles

**Good titles:**
- "Add exponential backoff pattern to API integration"
- "Fix incorrect memory_rethink guidance in concurrency section"
- "Clarify model selection criteria in letta-agent-designer"

**Bad titles:**
- "Updates" 
- "Fix stuff"
- "Improvements"

### Provide Context in Description

**Reviewers need to understand:**
- What you're changing
- Why you're changing it
- How you validated it's better
- What impact it has

**Don't assume context is obvious.** Even if it's clear to you, reviewers need the full picture.

### Be Open to Feedback

**Remember:**
- Reviewers want to help improve the contribution
- They may have insights you missed
- Discussion leads to better outcomes
- Iterate, don't defend

**If feedback suggests major changes:**
- Consider if they're right
- Discuss alternatives
- Be willing to withdraw PR and refine offline if needed

### Respond Promptly

**When reviewers give feedback:**
- Respond within reasonable time (hours/days, not weeks)
- If you need time, acknowledge and set expectations
- Keep discussion moving forward

## Common PR Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Minor Update to Existing Skill

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b fix/memory-concurrency-warning

# Edit file
# ... make changes ...

# Commit
git add ai/agents/letta/letta-memory-architect/SKILL.md
git commit -m "Make concurrent write warning more prominent

Data loss occurred when following guidance. Warning existed but 
wasn't prominent enough. Moving to top of section with clear example."

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/memory-concurrency-warning
gh pr create --title "Emphasize memory_insert for concurrent writes" --body "..."
```

### Scenario 2: New Skill Addition

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b add/api-rate-limiting

# Create skill structure
mkdir -p ai/models/api-rate-limiting
# ... create SKILL.md and references ...

# Update README
# ... add skill to list ...

# Commit
git add ai/models/api-rate-limiting README.md
git commit -m "Add API rate limiting skill

Covers exponential backoff, jitter, retry strategies for HTTP APIs.
Common pattern not previously documented."

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin add/api-rate-limiting
gh pr create --title "Add API rate limiting patterns" --body "..."
```

### Scenario 3: Major Restructuring

```bash
# Create branch  
git checkout -b refactor/memory-architecture-split

# Make changes across multiple files
# ... restructure skill ...

# Commit incrementally
git add ai/agents/letta/letta-memory-architect/SKILL.md
git commit -m "Split memory types into separate reference file"

git add letta/agent-development/references/memory-architecture.md
git commit -m "Create memory-types reference with detailed comparison"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin refactor/memory-architecture-split
gh pr create --title "Restructure memory-architect for clarity" --body "..."

2. Write clear PR descriptions with evidence
3. Keep PRs focused on single improvement
4. Respond constructively to feedback
5. Iterate based on discussion
6. Merge after approval

**Remember:** PRs aren't just bureaucracy - they're how we maintain quality and build shared understanding in our collective knowledge base.
